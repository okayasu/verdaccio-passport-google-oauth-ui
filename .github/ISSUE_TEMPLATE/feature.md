## Feature Request

### Description
<!-- Is your feature request related to a problem?
What does it solve or improve? Please describe. -->

We sometimes run out of coffee beans, especially on our all-hands.
We should stock up a small supply to give us more time to re-order.

### Suggested implementation
<!-- Please describe what the feature should do and how you would like it to work. -->

There's enough space in the cupboard. We would only need to make an order.
Let's re-order when there are only two bags left.

### Possible alternatives
<!-- Are you currently using a workaround?
Any alternative approaches that we should consider? -->

I have a personal emergency supply at my desk. Please don't tell anyone.

### Additional context
<!-- Sketches, configuration examples, or any other useful hints -->
